Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108956055.","""Feminist standpoint theory (FST) also stresses the partiality of perspectives and  the value of diversity in scientific communities. It builds on the idea that all  knowledge is situated: Knowers live in particular socio-historic contexts, face  particular material conditions, and occupy specific positions within a society’s  hierarchy. These circumstances create a variety of social locations that affect both  what someone can (or is likely to) know and what their status as a knower is. The  distinctive thesis of standpoint theory is that some of these social locations can be  developed into standpoints that come with epistemic advantages.""

","""a methodological tool that Robert N. Proctor has called “agnotology”—the study of culturally-induced ignorances—that serves as a counterweight to more traditional concerns for epistemology.4 Agnotology refocuses questions about “how we know” to include questions about what we do not know, and why not. Ignorance is often not merely the absence of knowledge but an outcome of cultural and political struggle. Nature, after all, is infinitely rich and variable. What we know or do not know at any one time or place is shaped by particular histories, local and global priorities, funding patterns, institutional and disciplinary hierarchies, personal and professional myopia, and much else as well.""

""Contributory injustices occur when knowers utilize epistemic resources that are inapt for understanding the potential contributions of particular knowers to our collective knowledge pool and thereby engage in a form of willful hermeneutical ignorance that refuses to employ more apt epistemic resources for receiving and appropriately responding to those contributions (Dotson 2012a: 31–32). In such cases, the knower who commits the wrong may treat other knowers as competent and trustworthy. Moreover, the knower who commits the wrong may be open to adjusting and developing currently shared epistemic resources"" (Pohlhaus ""Varieities of Epistemic Injustice: 20).","""For example, rather than shift one’s conception of workers and the workplace to more adequately attend to workers who are also child-bearers, one might seek to understand the concerns of this group of workers by further developing already existing systems such as understanding maternity leave as a sort of disability leave. But these remedies mistake the problem. Instead, a whole new approach is required, one in which axiomatic features of the previous collective epistemic resources may need to be abandone"" (Pohlhaus p. 20)",(produced by) willful hermeneutical ignorance; (type of) Epistemic Injustice; (part of) Epistemic Oppression

From the incidents, she developed somatic pain and was forced to quit her job. Wood applied for unemployment stating that she left for “personal reasons” (Fricker 2007: 150). Her claim was denied, however, since the termination cause was not considered justifiable at the time (pre-1970’s). Wood’s marginalized status, as a woman in a 1960’s workplace, meant that she was unable to stop the practice as it was not considered poor behavior by the institution or by broader social norms. Her status excluded her from communicating with those with social power (her employer). Eventually, Wood shared her experience with other women, who also reported similar interactions, which led to speak-outs and later filled a conceptual gap as women gave name to these negative social experiences: ‘sexual harassment’"" (Goldstein 2022: 1863).",(produces) hermeneutical injustice
